1. **Polymorphism**:
   - **Definition**: Allows objects to behave differently based on their specific type.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - **Method Overriding**: Subclasses can provide their own implementation of inherited methods.
     - **Method Overloading**: Multiple methods can share the same name but have different parameters.
     - **Runtime Binding**: Determines which method to call based on the actual type of the object.

2. **Inheritance**:
   - **Definition**: Enables a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - **Parent-Child Relationship**: Subclasses inherit features from their superclass.
     - **Code Reusability**: Subclasses can reuse code from their superclass.
     - **Method Overriding**: Subclasses can redefine methods inherited from their superclass.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - **Definition**: Bundles data and methods into a single unit, hiding the internal state from the outside world.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - **Data Hiding**: Protects internal data from direct access.
     - **Access Control**: Manages access to data through public, private, and protected modifiers.
     - **Modularity**: Organizes code into self-contained units for easier management.

4. **Abstraction**:
   - **Definition**: Focuses on essential features while hiding irrelevant details.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - **Focus on Essentials**: Highlights important aspects while omitting unnecessary details.
     - **Data Abstraction**: Defines classes with abstract data types representing real-world entities.
     - **Implementation Hiding**: Hides internal implementation details from users.
