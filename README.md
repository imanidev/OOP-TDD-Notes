# OOP TDD Notes

This repository contains notes on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) concepts. It covers key principles and practices related to OOP and TDD.

## Concepts Covered

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Polymorphism**: Allows objects to behave differently based on their specific type.
- **Inheritance**: Enables a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods into a single unit, hiding the internal state from the outside world.
- **Abstraction**: Focuses on essential features while hiding irrelevant details.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Writing Tests**: Creating tests before writing the actual code.
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: The TDD cycle of writing failing tests, making them pass, and then refactoring the code.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensuring that tests cover various scenarios and edge cases.
